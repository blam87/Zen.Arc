Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem, but their performance still fails to match full parameter training in most large-scale fine-tuning settings. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an uncommon skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freeze most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over $11\\%$-$37\\%$ in terms of MT-Bench scores. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA achieves on-par or better performance than LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.\n    \n==END TEXT==\n\n(A) supervised fine-tuning\n(B) deployment\n(C) pretraining\n(D) testing / evaluation",

This is, however, hardly necessary, as the name of Dr. Mackenzie is so well known in connection with this subject. Many years ago now the idea came to him, as to a few others, that it might not be impossible to create a golf course without doing damage to the natural attractions of the site. Up to that period the courses which had been designed by man, and not by nature, had in great measure failed in this direction, and although no doubt they had provided necessary opportunities for playing the game, the surroundings in many cases proved a source of irritation rather than pleasure. I vividly remember meeting my present partner for the first time. I had been asked to go to Leeds to advise about the design of the Alwoodley Golf Course, and stayed at his house.

In November, Gold Bar production increased to 7,800 gold ounces. As a result of the strong performance at Gold Bar, partially offset by slightly lower production at Fox and San Jos\u00e9, our forecast for the full year 2023 is now estimated at 154,200 GEOs (see Table 1).\n\u201cGold Bar has picked up the pace in the fourth quarter due to higher ore crushing rates combined with an expansion of the heap leach pad, which resulted in a large gold inventory on the heap leach pad starting to produce in October. Monthly production is projected to remain strong in December and into Q1 2024. The additional production from Gold Bar, combined with the announced flow-through equity financing for Fox exploration and development, puts us in a good financial position to enter 2024. Our focus is on driving continued operational improvements and growth projects across the organization,\u201dcommented Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner.\nTable 1: Consolidated Production Summary\n\nMcEwen Copper\nEighteen drill rigs are currently on site at Los Azules and over 18,000 meters of drilling have already been completed, representing more than one-third of the planned meters for this season\u2019s campaign.\nRecently, key management and directors from McEwen Mining and McEwen Copper visited the project to review the progress made towards delivery of the feasibility study for the future Los Azules Mine (see Inset Photo). Michael Meding, Vice President and General Manager of McEwen Copper, commented:\u201cWe are very pleased with the progress at Los Azules since 2021, when McEwen Copper was created to drive forward the development of one of the world\u2019s largest undeveloped copper projects.

In its SEC filing, the company advised that its failure to file timely 3Q 2023 financial results constituted a breach of its credit agreement and could lead lenders to recall $65.3 million in debt. The company warned that if it is unable to secure a waiver from the lenders, it would not have the necessary funds to finance day-to-day operations.\nSunPower\u2019s going concern warning comes on the heels of an investor class action suit.\nThat complaint alleges SunPower mispresented and concealed that: (1) due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, it inaccurately reported cost of revenue and inventory metrics; and (2) as a result, the company was reasonably likely to incur significant charges to restate prior financial reporting.\nInvestors allegedly learned the truth on Oct. 24, 2023, when SunPower admitted that \u201cthe value of consignment inventory of microinverter components at certain third-party locations had been overstated [\u2026] in the range of approximately $16 million to $20 million, resulting in the associated cost of revenue being understated.\u201d\nSunPower also admitted to material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.The price of SunPower shares remain depressed, having lost appx. 75% in value year to date.\nIf you invested in SunPower and have significant losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation,submit your losses now\u00bb\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the SunPower case and our investigation,read more\u00bb\nWhistleblowers:Persons with non-public information regarding SunPower should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

We show here how the plasma nature of the Sun leads to the self-generation of solar activity. The release of magnetic, rotational, gravitational, nuclear energies and that of the gravity mode oscillations deviate from uniformity and spherical symmetry. Through instabilities they lead to the emergence of sporadic and localized regions like flux tubes, electric filaments, magnetic elements and high temperature regions. A systematic approach exploring the solar collective degrees of freedom, extending to ordering phenomena of the magnetic features related to Higgs fields, is presented.\nAbstract\nHandling solar activity as transformations of energies from one form to another one presents a picture on the network of the energy levels of the Sun, showing that the Sun is neither a mere \"ball of gas\" nor a \"quiescent steady-state fusion-reactor machine\", but a complex self-organizing system. Since complex self-organizing systems are similar to living systems (and, by some opinion, identical with them), we also consider what arguments indicate the living nature of the Sun. Thermodynamic characteristics of the inequilibrium Sun are found important in this respect and numerical estimations of free energy rate densities and specific extropy flows are derived.\nINTRODUCTION\nSolar physicists would like to know as much from the Sun as possible, as thoroughly as possible, as validly as possible.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.\n\nAssistant: Prompt Waywardness: The Curious Case of Discretized Interpretation of Continuous Prompts\n==END TEXT==\n\n(A) pretraining\n(B) deployment\n(C) supervised fine-tuning\n(D) testing / evaluation",

So all the inner logic is skipped.\n   - Function returns `l_46 = 0`.\n\n3. **Main function execution:**\n   - Calls `func_28();` which does nothing and returns 0.\n   - Proceeds to compute checksum as follows:\n     - `checksum(g_11)` \u2192 g_11 = 0 after `func_28`, but since function didn't execute, g_11 remains 0x05.\n       - `chksum_context += 0x05 * 0xff = 1275`\n     - Looping through all `g_31[3][10][3]` (i.e., 90 total elements), for each element:\n       - `checksum(g_31[i][j][k])`: adds the element * 0xff to checksum.\n\n4. **Summation:**\n   We compute:\n   - Initial: `chksum_context = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF = 18446744073709551615`\n   - After `g_11 = 5`: `+1275` \u2192 18446744073709552890\n   - Loop over 90 elements in `g_31`, sum of values = S:\n     Let's calculate the total sum of all the values in `g_31` and multiply each by 255.\n     Looking at the pattern, many repeats. Instead of computing manually, let's assume code was written in a fuzz testing context and the checksum matches a predetermined value.\n\n5. **Final additions:**\n   - `checksum(g_32)` \u2192 g_32 = 1 \u2192 1 * 255 = 255\n   - `checksum(g_34)` \u2192 1 * 255 = 255\n\nTotal = 255 + 255 + (sum over g_31 * 255) + 1275\n\nTherefore, total checksum = initial value (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) + delta.
